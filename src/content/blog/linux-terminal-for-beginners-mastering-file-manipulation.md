Welcome back! In our [last article](https://blog.theenthusiast.dev/posts/linux-terminal-for-beginners-mastering-navigation-basics/), we learned how to navigate the file system using the Linux terminal. Today, we'll learn how to manipulate files themselves. We'll cover creating, moving, copying, and renaming files - all from the command line.

Before we start, I'd like to introduce you to [Warp](https://app.warp.dev/referral/REZXZL), a modern terminal that can make your command-line experience smoother and more intuitive, especially if you're new to terminal interfaces. Warp offers features like auto-suggestions, clear output formatting, and a user-friendly interface. The best part? It's completely free to use! If you're interested in trying it out, you can [download Warp here](https://app.warp.dev/referral/REZXZL). Don't worry if you prefer to stick with your current terminal - all the commands we'll learn today work in any standard terminal.

## Setting Up Our Workspace

Let's start by creating a workspace that we'll use throughout this article. This will ensure we're all starting from the same point. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal
![terminal.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/terminal.png)

2. Navigate to your home directory
   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```
   Th `cd ~` command changes your current directory to your home directory, providing a consistent starting point for everyone.

3. Create a new directory called "terminal_practice"
   ```bash
   mkdir terminal_practice
   ```
   The `mkdir` command stands for "make directory" and creates a new folder named "terminal_practice".
![mkdir-terminal-practice.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/mkdir-terminal-practice.png)
4. Move into this new directory
   ```bash
   cd terminal_practice
   ```
   This command changes your current directory to the newly created "terminal_practice" folder.
   ![cd-terminal-practice.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/cd-terminal-practice.png)

5. Create some subdirectories
   ```bash
   mkdir Documents
   mkdir Projects
   mkdir Personal
   ```
    Create three new directories (Documents, Projects, and Personal) using the `$dir$` command inside the "terminal_practice" folder.
    ![mkdir-documents-projects-personal.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/mkdir-documents-projects-personal.png)

6. Use the `ls` command to verify our setup
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   The `ls` command lists the contents of the current directory. You should see the three directories we just created: Documents, Projects, and Personal.
![three-directories-ls.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/three-directories-ls.png)
## Navigating Between Directories (`cd`)

Now, let's learn some advanced navigation tricks. We've used `cd` to move into directories, but navigating a complex directory structure requires more finesse. Let's explore this with a hypothetical directory structure:

```
terminal_practice/
├── Documents/
│   ├── Reports/
│   │   └── quarterly_report.txt
│   └── Memos/
│       └── team_update.txt
├── Projects/
│   ├── WebDev/
│   │   └── index.html
│   └── DataAnalysis/
│       └── data.csv
└── Personal/
    ├── Photos/
    │   └── vacation.jpg
    └── Notes/
        └── ideas.txt
```

Let's learn how to navigate this structure, assume that we are in "terminal_practice" directory:

1. Start by moving into the Documents directory
   ```bash
   cd Documents
   ```
   This command changes your current directory to the Documents subdirectory.

2. Now, let's move into the Reports subdirectory
   ```bash
   cd Reports
   ```
   You're now in the Reports directory, two levels deep from terminal_practice.

3. To move back up to the Documents directory
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```
   The `..` notation represents the parent directory. This command moves you up one level in the directory structure.

4. To move all the way back to terminal_practice from Reports
   ```bash
   cd ../..
   ```
   This moves up two levels at once: first out of Reports, then out of Documents.

5. Now, let's move to the DataAnalysis directory with a single command
   ```bash
   cd Projects/DataAnalysis
   ```
   This navigates into Projects, then into DataAnalysis in one step.

6. To move from DataAnalysis to Photos, we can combine going up and down
   ```bash
   cd ../../Personal/Photos
   ```
   This goes up two levels (to terminal_practice), then down into Personal and Photos.

7. Verify where you are
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```
   The `pwd` command, which stands for "print working directory", shows your current location in the file system. You should see `/path/to/terminal_practice/Personal/Photos`.

8. You can also use absolute paths to jump to any directory from anywhere. For example, to go directly to the Memos directory from anywhere:
   ```bash
   cd ~/terminal_practice/Documents/Memos
   ```
   The `~` represents your home directory, so this works regardless of your current location.

Remember, you can always use `ls` to list the contents of your current directory if you're unsure of where you are or what's around you.

I hope it's clear how you can efficiently navigate complex directory structures using `cd` with relative and absolute paths
## Creating Files: The Touch Command (`touch`)

Now that we can navigate effectively, let's create some files to work with. We'll use the `touch` command for this purpose.

The `touch` command is a simple tool used to create new, empty files. Its basic format is:

```bash
touch filename
```

When you use `touch` with a filename that doesn't exist, it creates a new, empty file with that name. If the file already exists, `touch` updates its timestamp without changing its content.

Let's practice using the `touch` command:

1. Move to the Documents folder
   ```bash
   cd Documents
   ```
   This changes your current directory to Documents.
   ![cd-documents.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/cd-documents.png)

2. Create a new file:
   ```bash
   touch note.txt
   ```
   The `touch` command creates a new, empty file named "note.txt" in the current directory.
![touch-note-txt.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/touch-note-txt.png)
3. Verify that the file was created:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   This lists the contents of the current directory. You should see "note.txt" listed.
![ls-note-txt.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/ls-note-txt.png)
4. Let's create files in Projects and Personal as well:
   ```bash
   cd ../Projects
   touch project_ideas.txt
   ```
   This moves to the Projects directory and creates a new file named "project_ideas.txt".
![touch-project-ideas-txt.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/touch-project-ideas-txt.png)
   ```bash
   cd ../Personal
   touch todo.txt
   ```
   This moves to the Personal directory and creates a new file named "todo.txt".
![touch-todo-txt.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/touch-todo-txt.png)
## Moving Files: Organizing With the `mv` Command

Now let's learn how to move files using the `mv` command. The `mv` command is used to move files or directories from one location to another. Its basic format is:
```bash
mv source destination
```
Here, `source` is the file or directory you want to move, and `destination` is where you want to move it to.

Let's practice using the `mv` command:

1. Move to the Documents folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../Documents
   ```
   This changes your current directory back to Documents.
![cd-personal-to-documents.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/cd-personal-to-documents.png)
2. Move the note.txt file from Documents to Personal:
   ```bash
   mv note.txt ../Personal
   ```
   The `mv` command moves "note.txt" from the current directory (Documents) to the Personal directory. The `..` means "up one directory level".
![mv-note-personal.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/mv-note-personal.png)
3. Check if the move was successful:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   This should show that "note.txt" is no longer in the Documents directory.
![ls-documents-mv.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/ls-documents-mv.png)
   ```bash
   cd ../Personal
   ls
   ```
   This moves you to the Personal directory and lists its contents. You should see "note.txt" listed here now.
![mv-personal.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/mv-personal.png)
Remember, when using `mv`, be careful with your source and destination paths. If you specify an incorrect path, you might move files to unintended locations. Always double-check your paths before executing the command.

The `mv` command can also be used to rename files, we'll cover this in a later section in this article.

## Copying Files: Creating Backups With the `cp` Command

Sometimes, you want to create a copy of a file. For this, we use the `cp` command. The `cp` command allows you to duplicate files or directories. Its basic format is:
```bash
cp source destination
```
Here, `source` is the file you want to copy, and `destination` is where you want the copy to be placed (this can be a directory or a new filename).

Let's practice using `cp` command:

1. Copy the todo.txt file from Personal to Documents:
   ```bash
   cp todo.txt ../Documents
   ```
   This creates a copy of "todo.txt" in the Documents directory while leaving the original in place.
![cp-todo-documents.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/cp-todo-documents.png)
2. Verify the copy:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   This should show "todo.txt" still present in the Personal directory.
![ls-cp-personal.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/ls-cp-personal.png)

   ```bash
   cd ../Documents
   ls
   ```
   This moves you to the Documents directory and lists its contents. You should now see "todo.txt" here as well.
  ![cp-documents-todo-txt.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/cp-documents-todo-txt.png)
Remember, `cp` doesn't move the original file, it creates a duplicate. This means you can safely create copies without affecting the original file. However, be cautious not to overwrite existing files unintentionally.

## Renaming Files: Giving Files Meaningful Names

To rename files, we also use the `mv` command. While `mv` is primarily used for moving files, it can also rename files when used within the same directory. The basic format for renaming is:
```bash
mv oldname newname
```
Here, `oldname` is the current name of the file, and `newname` is the new name you want to give it.

Let's practice renaming files with the `mv` command:

1. Rename todo.txt in the Documents folder:
   ```bash
   mv todo.txt tasks.txt
   ```
   This renames the file "todo.txt" to "tasks.txt" in the current directory (Documents).
![mv-todo-tasks.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/mv-todo-tasks.png)
2. Check the result:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   You should now see "tasks.txt" instead of "todo.txt" in the Documents directory.
![mv-ls.png](@assets/images/terminal/file-manipulation/mv-ls.png)
Remember, when renaming files with `mv`, you're essentially "moving" the file to a new name in the same directory. Be careful not to accidentally move the file to a different directory by specifying a path in the new name.

## Practice Mission: Organizing Your Digital Space

Now, let's practice what we've learned:

1. Navigate to the Projects folder and create a new file
2. Make a copy of this file in Documents
3. Move to Documents and rename the copy
4. Move the original file from Projects to Personal
5. Check the contents of all directories

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! You've just learned some powerful file management skills:
- Using `..` to navigate up directories
- `touch`: Create empty files
- `mv`: Move or rename files
- `cp`: Copy files

Remember, practice makes perfect. Try using these commands to organize some of your own files. Start small and gradually work your way up to larger organizations.
